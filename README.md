### Minhas impress√µes
Curti a iniciativa, por√©m o framework √© opnativo demais ao meu ver. Al√©m de criar o SPA com ele (o que dificultou fazer algumas configura√ßoes, (SASS, por exemplo))

Apesar de ser uma solu√ß√£o completa para o que ele se destina, achei que o app ficou amarrado demais ao framework. Se fosse um Hook me trazendo os data do wordpress ja serviria.
